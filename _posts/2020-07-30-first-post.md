exerpt: this is the first blog

## a new blog site
This is my first blog using [github pages powered by jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the project [https://github.com/Aemilia-VonWunderland/my-blog](https://github.com/Aemilia-VonWunderland/my-blog). 

Learning materials:
- The website of jekyll itself is a good example of github pages. From github project () into io (), redirect to its custom domain ().
- Other examples https://github.com/collections/github-pages-examples

## steps to post a blog here
- write a blog in markdown, and save the file to _posts (note the template: should add "front matter")
- name the file: YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-the-post.md
- git add, commit, push
- I don't even need to install jekyll locally! Github.io will render it.

## problems:

1. url to the post: missing repo/project name
Solution: add repo name manually
Here is someone also meeting the problem https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/332


2. how to use theme provided?
It worked when I first create it on github and use html, but it doesn't work when 
I change index.html

theme and layout is conflicting??
